# CS371
Right now the code contains a variety of stubs handling different objectives just as relics of past tests. 
Right now it will read 100 packets and save all of them by flow id
Using dictionary structure each flow idea has a value
that value right now is just a counter for number of times that flow has been observed
but the end goal will be to have the value contain the feature data
it's not really much harder to just store value as tuple with all the relevant information
